# Homing squence

As addressed in [kinematic page](./kinematic.md), extended-coreXY design an address gantry skew problem of traditional CoreXY, but require special homing squence.


![homing](./homing.jpg)

- For example, we have skewed gantry like in fig.1 and we home Y axis with independ endtops C0 and C1 on the front.
- C0 switch will trigger first
- To trigger C1, C1 motor with short belt path will pull and force the gantry square.
- We have square gantry now, but the inner belt path (A and B) will be in unbalance state because they are force pulled by the C1 motor and belt. 

To fix the unbalenced belt problem we need the following homing squence.

- Home X axis
- Move toolhead to middle of the X axis (so the distance between toolhead and motor of A and B somewhat equal)
- Home Y axis
- Disable AB motor (to release the inner unbalanced belt tension)
- Re-enable AB motors
- Re-home X axis


This is the example of <code>[homing_override]</code> i have on my machine
